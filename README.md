# Plugin to add custom registratio fields to the NodeBB registration form

This plugin was created to add custom fields to the registration page and link the data to custom profile fields generated using [Nicolas Siver's Custom Fields Plugin](https://github.com/NicolasSiver/nodebb-plugin-ns-custom-fields).

## General Use

This plugin was designed on top of [Nicolas Siver's Custom Fields Plugin](https://github.com/NicolasSiver/nodebb-plugin-ns-custom-fields) along with the "Persona" theme and "Paper" skin.

This plugin has not been developed for easy customization/translation but may hopefully serve as an example for those looking to build their own custom registration forms.

## Future Improvements

- Easier customization through the admin panel (flexibility when creating or deleting custom fields)

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-custom-registration-fields
